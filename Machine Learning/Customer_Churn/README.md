Got it ✅ — I’ve gone through your **Customer_Churn_Prediction.ipynb** file, analyzed the data, preprocessing, models, and evaluation steps, and prepared a clean, professional **README.md** that you can directly use for your GitHub repository.  

Here’s the structured README:

# 🏦 Customer Churn Prediction

## 📌 Overview
This project builds a **machine learning workflow** to predict whether a bank customer will **churn** (leave the bank) based on demographic, account, and service usage data.  
By identifying at-risk customers, businesses can design targeted retention strategies.

The task is formulated as a **binary classification problem** (`Exited = 1` means churn, `Exited = 0` means customer stays).

## 📂 Dataset
Dataset Link - Kaggle [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shantanudhakadd/bank-customer-churn-prediction]
The dataset contains **10,000 customer records** with the following fields:

- **RowNumber, CustomerId, Surname** — Identifiers (not used for modeling)
- **CreditScore** — Customer's credit rating
- **Geography** — Country (`France`, `Spain`, `Germany`)
- **Gender** — Male / Female
- **Age** — Customer's age
- **Tenure** — Number of years the customer has stayed with the bank
- **Balance** — Amount in customer’s bank account
- **NumOfProducts** — Number of bank products subscribed to
- **HasCrCard** — Does the customer have a credit card (1/0)
- **IsActiveMember** — Active member status (1/0)
- **EstimatedSalary** — Annual estimated salary
- **Exited** — **[Target variable]** 1 = Churned, 0 = Stayed

## ⚙️ Project Workflow

1. **Import Libraries**
   - `pandas`, `numpy` for data processing
   - `matplotlib`, `seaborn` for visualization
   - `scikit-learn` for ML models and preprocessing

2. **Data Loading & Cleaning**
   - Read CSV data into a Pandas DataFrame
   - Drop `RowNumber`, `CustomerId`, `Surname`
   - Check for missing values (none found)

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualize churn vs. non-churn distribution
   - Analyze numerical features (CreditScore, Age, Balance)
   - Explore churn rate by geography, gender, and account activity

4. **Feature Engineering & Encoding**
   - One-Hot Encode categorical variables:
     - `Geography` → `Geography_France`, `Geography_Spain`, `Geography_Germany`
     - `Gender` → `Gender_Male` (binary flag)
   - Maintain only numerical + encoded columns

5. **Train-Test Split**
   ```python
   from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
   X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
   ```

6. **Model Training** *(multiple algorithms tested)*
   - Logistic Regression (LR)
   - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
   - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
   - Decision Tree (DT)
   - Random Forest (RF)
   - Gradient Boosting Classifier (GBC)

7. **Model Evaluation**
   - Metric: **Accuracy**
   - Results:
     | Model | Accuracy |
     |-------|----------|
     | Logistic Regression | 0.809 |
     | SVM                 | 0.865 |
     | KNN                 | 0.872 |
     | Decision Tree       | 0.793 |
     | Random Forest       | 0.840 |
     | Gradient Boosting   | 0.867 |

   - KNN achieved the highest accuracy (0.872) in this run.

## 📈 Results & Insights
- **Age**, **Geography**, and **IsActiveMember** showed high influence on churn.
- **KNN** achieved the highest accuracy (87.2%).
- Ensemble methods like **Gradient Boosting** also performed well.

***

## 🔮 Future Improvements
- Try **deep learning** models (ANNs) for better generalization.
- Apply **hyperparameter tuning** (GridSearchCV, RandomizedSearch).
- Use **SMOTE** or similar techniques if class imbalance is significant.
- Incorporate **probability outputs** for better business decision-making.


## 🙌 Acknowledgments
- Dataset provided by standard Kaggle churn prediction challenges.
- **CodSoft** for giving me this task.  

Do you want me to go ahead and make that as well? That way, you can directly push it to GitHub without adjustments.
