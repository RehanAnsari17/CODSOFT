## About the Internship

This internship offered hands-on experience in building and deploying machine learning models focused on real-world problems. The aim was to complete at least three assigned tasks to successfully fulfill the internship requirements.[4][3]

## Tasks Completed

1. **Credit Card Fraud Detection**  
   Developed a classification model to detect fraudulent transactions in credit card datasets. Techniques included data preprocessing, model tuning, and evaluation.

2. **Customer Churn Prediction**  
   Built a predictive analytics model that estimates customer churn for various business scenarios using historic customer data and machine learning algorithms.

3. **Movie Genre Classification**  
   Created a text-based classifier to predict a movie's genre from its plot summary using NLP techniques (TF-IDF, embeddings) and suitable classifiers.

4. **Spam SMS Detection**  
   Implemented a model to classify SMS messages as spam or legitimate using NLP (TF-IDF or word embeddings) with classifiers such as Naive Bayes and SVM.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RehanAnsari17/CODSOFT.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the relevant folder for each project.

3. Install required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Open the Jupyter notebook and run the code sections.

## Results & Evaluation

Each project folder contains details of data preprocessing, model training steps, evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score), and explanations of the outcomes.
